This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.


## Generate random integer

```python
from random import randint, seed
from random import random
import time
seed(time.time())

for i in range(500):
	print(randint(-10000, 10000), end=" ")
print()
```
